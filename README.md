# Classification with SVM and KNN

This repository demonstrates the use of **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** and **k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** for classifying a dataset. The analysis includes data loading, model training, parameter tuning, and visualization. It is organized as an **R Markdown file** for easy documentation and reproducibility.

## **Contents**

1. **`KKNN/KSVM Modules`**:
   - R Markdown file containing the complete code and explanations.
   - Includes:
     - Data loading and preprocessing.
     - SVM classification with linear and non-linear kernels.
     - Parameter tuning for SVM (`C` parameter).
     - Visualization of data separability using PCA.
     - KNN classification with optimal \( k \).

2. **Dataset**:
   - This dataset is taken from the UC Irvine Machine Learning repository     ```

3. **Generated Files**:
   - Rendered HTML or PDF output of the R Markdown file.
